# Function for counting the occurrences of each word in the string, where words are separated by spaces.
def word_count(string):
  counts = dict()
  words = string.split()

  for word in words:
    if word in counts:
      counts[word] += 1
    else:
      counts[word] = 1
  return counts
# Using this code the punctiation at the end of a word is counted as a part of the word.

#for example "This a sentence." will give This: 1, a: 1, sentance.: 1


# An other try:
import re

def word_count(string):
  count = dict()
  count = sum(1 for _ in re.finditer(r'\b%s\b' % re.escape(word), input_string)) # not sure if it works

  return count
